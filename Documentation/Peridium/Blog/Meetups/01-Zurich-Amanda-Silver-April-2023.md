# Meetup – .NET User Group Zürich, April 24th 2023

I went to the Zürich Meetup event recently, where Amanda Silver, Corporate VP of Microsoft’s DevDiv gave a talk and answered questions, which lead to a surge of reflection and contemplation. This is an open letter to Amanda.


First, I got to say this, move over Scott Hanselman, you are no longer the okayest role model for me, when I grow up, I want to be like Amanda Silver.
The talk was my first work-related in-person appearance since the beginning of the Corona pandemic lock downs, my interpersonal neurons were rusty, and my brain was nearly overloaded with the process of adapting to real-time communication again. So, there were things I would like to know more about, but couldn’t express coherently then and there, and I have some further questions for you. 

I don’t expect everything to be answered, asking these questions are primarily a means for processing what I learn, it's about reflection and contemplation for improving my map of the world. I am sorry if I rant more than I should, but if you can work with people like James Montemagno, Jon Galloway, Maddy Montaquila and the other professional ranters on Microsoft’s YouTube channels, I expect you can handle it. You just gave me a lot of food for thought at this meetup and I wanted to return the favor.

The views and opinions found here are from my singular point of view, I do not respresent any one but myself, it just reflections of my life as a self-taught code slinger, who has only worked solo on my own projects, with no education, mentors, or network to lean on, and is now trying to find a way into the world of professional development, as well as a father of a six-year old who may someday want to learn the craft. Thus, my perception of the software industry is most likely biased and simplistic, as I have had limited feedback on my outlook on things that I have merely pondered about for the sake of pondering and not put to the test in the real world.


### Untapped power

“How can I make developers more productive and better able to express what they are trying to achieve?” and “To be a vehicle for all the untapped power of all the developers in world is a pretty great mission.”

In the talk in Zürich, you showed that we can now set up environments, workspaces, and tools fast and easily, so people can start coding/building/producing in a short time. It is easy to see how this can bring out untapped power and productivity for anyone just starting out, and how experienced developers can get more done in less time and with less effort. With those obstacles out of the way, what is the next big hurdle for unleashing untapped potential?


### Experience is dead, long live experience.

There are a lot of opinions about what makes an experienced, or senior, developer, and when are you no longer a junior? Regardless of the specific criteria, most companies and organizations seem to want experienced developers. Occasionally I read about recruiting developers with the skills and experience needed is a challenge for employers, some even call it a shortage crisis. On the other hand, new developers spend a lot of time and effort to get their foot in the door so they can start gaining the much sought after experience and improve their skills.

As tools become better at getting people started and at the same time make experienced developers more productive/valuable the disparity could become even greater. The result is a chicken-and-egg problem, where development power remains untapped, as employers and job seekers use a lot of energy and time on acquiring each other’s attention and finding a good match for both parties instead of producing software. 

So, how do we break out of this pattern? Is it more or less up to educators to prepare students better, should employers or governments subsidize/sponsor juniors more (i.e., through GitHub sponsor), or can technology and tools help disentangle the situation?

### Deversity 

You have said we need a more diverse set of developers in the world, and the more developers (at different levels of the stack) we can bring into the market the better for business, the better for end users, and the better for humanity: Do the educational requirements most employers wish for in the industry encourage monoculture, with similar values, similar experiences, similar mindsets? How can we maximize education and diversity at the same time?

Similarly, tools make it easier to write consistent, correct, and effective code, but what does it mean for diversity, creativity, accidental discoveries, developing resilience to handle mistakes?
How do we avoid groupthink, consensus bias, filter-bubbles and instead cultivate playful exploration, curiosity, and an experimental mindset if the easy solution is always available?

With tools like ChatGPT, asking the right questions become more important than knowing the right answer and again we may see a chicken-and-egg problem: in order to know what questions to ask, to be able to evaluate the response, and to add clarifying information you need experience, but some of the most useful (and valuable to employers/customers) experience comes from hard earned lessons, that come from doing things wrong and paying the price for it, which is what we are trying to avoid by using these tools. Knowing an answer, finding a solution (to a well-defined problem), is mostly about explicit knowledge, but what employers look for in their teams is probably more implicit knowledge, because explicit knowledge is easy to teach. I think that there wouldn’t be a high demand for experienced IT workers if the needed knowledge could be taught effectively through books, videos, and training courses.

I mean, if I could upload knowledge, like in the Matrix, I suspect that learning Kung-Fu this way might take longer than the traditional approach, because I would just injure myself and then spend more time healing, recovering and then train physically to avoid more injures, as my body is not ready for the movements: it does not have the strength, flexibility and proprioceptive experience to perform martial arts. In the real world of software development, information is abundant for upgrading our skills, even if we can’t upload it to our brains, yet we need to practice the craft in the real world before we can make good use of all this information. 
Unleashing masses of barely trained cowboy coders, high on their own supply of Dunning-Kruger cool-aid, boosted by the assurance of their AI’s support, doesn’t sound like the dream scenario for employers, end users, nor the colleagues of such developers. Experience will be gained, but the kind you’d rather be without. 

On the opposite side you may have people struggling with insecurity. Like helicopter parenting seemingly protects children from getting into trouble, and gives a false appearance of doing things right, nearly perfect tools and assistants could undermine a developer’s self-esteem in the long run, because inevitably they get into situations where they must solve problems on their own. As a manager or educator, as well as a parent, you need to allow for mistakes to happen, you have to remove the training wheels even though you know they will be more likely to get hurt, because if you don’t they will not learn how to balance themselves, and if they always have training wheels on they will be less flexible in where they can go, slower, and unable to share bikes with others. I guess Scott Hanselman would use a car with manual gears as an analogy here, but since most cars will be electrical in the future the days are numbered for this reference, you may want to tell him he needs to come up with new analogy.

I am not expecting you, or anyone for that matter, to resolve the underlying educational dilemma, I just wonder if you have any ideas for what developers in the future can do to gain (the right kind of) experience. The same question applies to employers and educators, what can they do?

### The Future

One way to view the evolution of IT is that we have gone from data management to information management, to knowledge management. What’s the next stage, do you think we are on the path to wisdom management? Is such a thing possible? 

In other words, is it possible to maximize integration of knowledge from all the different parts that are our lives. Not a blurring of the lines between work and other things, nor a separation, but purposefully differentiated, interdependent and suitably related to each other. Software is an integrated part of many products we use, many activities we do, and of course many tools we benefit from. A great deal of profit is made from this integration, a lot of jobs created, so can we extract some principles of integration to apply to other areas of life? 

In the “Mission Driven Careers” interview you mentioned that Kevin Scott said there is potential dystopian future for tech and a potential utopian future for tech, and that part of his motivation for working was to influence which direction we move, so do you believe we are moving towards the utopian future, and how can we tell, what are the signs we should look out for and try to move towards, what could be an indication that we are going in the wrong direction?

### Transcendence

I think you have been under the influence of science, as I recall, your father was a physicist, so you may be familiar with the concept of consilience: the linking together of principles from different disciplines especially when forming a comprehensive theory.
I would say consilience and wisdom are quite analogous, so we could also ask ourselves, are we moving towards a consilience of doing and being, of health and productivity, of meaningful work and profit?

A more down to earth approach to contemplate consilience might be can we use our successful tools from work in other contexts (and vice versa). In the Build - After hours video with Scott Hanselman in a tiny house, you said you would like a heatmap of how people move in the house. This is an example of how a tool can be adapted to other disciplines. And if it works in a couple of disciplines, why not more?

Have you ever tried to do something similar in the context of private life, family, households? Can you apply the principles of fast feedback cycles within a family? Would a customer focused approach to managing household chores be appropriate, how about for bedtimes, or homework? Is it possible to adapt code reviews, issue tracking, kanban boards, KPIs, OKRs, etc. to family and household activities?

Since you gave the talk at the Circle in Zürich it now seems appropriate to circle back to diversity and experience, as I think that consilience goes hand in hand with these. To use a tiny house project as an example, when a plumber, electrician, or carpenter walks into a house they see the same things, but they experience them in diverse ways. Each of them probably has a good idea of what the others do and need, and they all know there are universal principles of building, maintaining, and improving houses that they share. Experienced craftsmen also realize that being good at what they do isn’t always about what they know about their own problem space, but also how well they can interact with the other craftsmen, architects, customers. 

The crafts involved in building a house have a long track record, with many lessons learned, a lot of principles and best practices have been discovered, refined, and established as best practices. Tools and machines have been invented and improved upon continuously, making it easier, faster, safer to build something. This doesn’t mean work in this area is uniform, purely mechanical, or that there is no creativity involved. Building things is an ancient discipline but we still haven’t perfected it, many of the construction projects I have seen, heard of, or read about have been delayed, over budget, and/or not living up to expectations, so critical thinking, creativity is still needed to make things better for even the oldest crafts.

Given the long history of building houses, and what DevDiv does, I mean you build tools for builders, there’s even a Build conference, do you get inspiration from “real” builders, tool makers, educators in the construction and building management industry, do you exchange stories, lessons learned, principles discovered or discuss common practices that work or not?

The reason I am curious about this is that my first job was as an assistant janitor (I suppose some would call it Associate Facilities Manager today), and I have found that maintaining physical frequently involves the same skills, abilities and attitudes that are involved in maintaining software projects, and IT systems in general. 
People with a knack for solving problems in the physical world may find it difficult to adapt to the abstract and academic nature of software development, which could be why they work in with tangible problems in the first place, but that shouldn’t mean they don’t have useful knowledge or insights that software developers could benefit from. Then again, some of the people working in physical jobs may have an aptitude for solving problems with code, because the process of finding solutions is similar in some ways, they just don’t know it.

So, with regards to unleashing untapped powers I wonder if more can be done to integrate other professions with software development and help some of them discover untapped powers that can lead to more diverse and better software.

There are doctors working with Formula 1 engineers to improve telemetry for patients, which is brilliant in a way, but also food for thought: how come the need for speed is has led to more progress in diagnostic tools than the need for health? Assuming the Formula 1 team got better at collecting data because they had more resources, better talent working for them and did more research, I wonder if it is an indication that we value racing more than health. I enjoy motor racing more than most, but I would pick more effective medical treatments over a more effective drive.

Can we do more to encourage cross-pollination like this, can inspiration at the inter-organizational or cultural level be nurtured, rather than waiting for a brilliant few to make it happen? For software development, if we can inspire people to get more directly involved in developing technology will we free up more untapped developer powers, and/or improve communication with people outside our industry to reduce time and effort wasted on misunderstandings if we can do so? 

### Nature and nurture

Throughout its existence Microsoft has been finding common actions done by diverse users, create abstract interfaces, add concrete implementations for as many scenarios as possible (like separation of concern and dependency injection). Initially it was at a low level, separating the DOS kernel and system specific drivers allowed a diverse set of PC and component manufacturers to use common interfaces for users to operate a multitude of different devices. 

Later, the graphical user interface was the vehicle for expanding the scope of abstract interfaces, with windows, buttons, icons, cursors providing a common interface to execute concrete implementations. 

For certain groups of users, some Microsoft products weren’t initially superior to other solutions. Word Perfect, Page Maker, Lotus SmartSuite, Novell and several other leading software solutions of their time had good products for their specific customers, so why are they no longer the default choice they once where?
Today we see a similar pattern for cloud solutions, which are creating abstract interfaces to hardware, infrastructure, operating systems which reminds me of how MSDOS.sys, IO.sys and device drivers did it in the past.

I think dependency inversion played a role in Microsoft’s success. Microsoft’s products decoupled high level aspects of computers from the low-level implementation, for example, a secretary should not depend on WordPerfect on a specific computer, with a specific keyboard, specific mouse, specific monitor, and so on, instead writing activities can be implemented with MS Office, with the same interface regardless of use case, platform, or even experience level.

Internet Explorer, Silverlight, ActiveX, and other less liked products tried to make concrete implementations the only interface, making users and developers depend on these products rather than the product providing an interface help you achieve your goals. No matter how good the products were at doing what they were designed to do, they were difficult to substitute, to adapt to an increasingly fast changing world. Besides Microsoft products and solutions there were a lot of other companies and technologies wreaking havoc when abstractions depend on details, Flash Player, Real Player, Java Runtime, PS/2, are just a few that comes to my mind.

Obviously, there’s a lot more to the story, it’s a super simplified model (and all models are wrong), and there are always exceptions to the rule. This is just an attempt at a rough outline to show that integration plays a major role in all aspects of our lives, when Microsoft integrated good programming practices in business and good business practices in programming, things tended to go better than when they didn’t. 

Are there analogous principles to SOLID taught in the business world, construction industry, health industry, and so on? Vice versa, are there any concepts programmers can integrate from the other professions? Not just for making coding better, but also to bridge the gap between developers and clients, for making the transition from one profession to another easier as the demand for various jobs may change faster and faster in the future. 

I’m not an expert here, I just started learning SOLID a couple of months ago, someone more experienced could probably explain it better than me, perhaps find some flaws in the analysis too, and I haven’t thought about this enough to tell if the rest of the SOLID principles can be used to understand a company’s results, though coming up with and analysing more examples seems like a fun way to reinforce what I have learned until now, so I might have a go at it some other day.

Maybe you can experiment with this in your bootcamps, maybe you already do? 

Another fascinating aspect of this inquiry, for me, is that it lets me see that businesses are sometimes like nature, the previous paragraphs remind me of fractals found in nature. The way a company operates at scale can sometimes be seen it the way it implements details, just like we often see it I nature, structures repeat at different scales in trees, leaves, clouds, beaches and so on.

I wonder if Bill Gates, Paul Allen, and movers and shakers of Microsoft’s products and services like yourself perceived this. When you were shaping things to come, was there any awareness of the fractal pattern in the work, the integration of integrative people, products, processes. Did it involve a conscious effort to apply good software practices to organizational and business processes (was it done with deliberate intention, as Scott Hanselman might say) or is it maybe a natural emergent property of managing complex software projects? 

The previous point may apply to other industries as well, for instance, do hospitals apply principles learned from medical procedures to diagnose and heal ailments in finance, company culture, building management, and so on?

Do fitness trainers use progressive overload for improving communication skills? Do carpenters measure twice and cut once when hiring new staff? Do scientists apply the scientific method to find the right venue for their next conference?

I suspect in most of the previous cases they do not do it explicitly, but maybe some osmosis-like effect takes place, and the mental tools we use frequently for our primary work start influencing other areas of our life and tools become natural extensions of us.

Marshall McLuhan said it more succinctly: “We shape our tools, then our tools shape us.”

What I would like to know is what can we do to discover the best tools? How can we transfer these tools from one field to another, from experts to novices? We can sit and wait for the next Gang of Four to appear to enlighten us, DevDiv to invent something for us, or can each of us do something to foster discovery and innovation in tool shaping and tool sharing?

I probably violated all of Grice’s maxims at this point, so I will end this here, although I have more ideas to discuss they are still too incomplete and confusing in my own mind for me to fit them in here. The thoughts and ideas presented here also need a lot more refinement, refactoring and debugging you might say, but I think it is more useful to discuss them while the memories of the meetup are still fresh in our minds.

Thank you for showing up in my part of the world, if you hadn’t, I doubt I would have given much thought to any of these issues, it was a great motivator for coming out of my social hibernation too, and you did convince me to try out GitHub Copilot, so I will proceed to play around with that now.
