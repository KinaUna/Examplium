# Documentation Overview


#### Got something to say about the docmentation?

Then you can add your own comments, ideas, complaints to the discussion here: [Examplium Discussions](https://github.com/KinaUna/Examplium/discussions)

<br />

#### Other documentation

This will be main entry point for documentation, but it will not be possible to add everything here. So, why here? Because adding the documentation to the code section will keep everything together: When someone clones/forks the repository the documentation will also be copied. This way, it will also have all the benefits of Git, so the documentation will have a complete history of changes, a timeline, and can make use of tags, issues, and so on.

If you cannot find something you may want to have a look at these other tools/sections:

- Issues: This section is used to track bugs, enhancements, and feature requests. 
- Discussions: A place to share thoughts, feedback, questions, comments.
- Projects: A tool for planning and tracking work (Kanban?). [Read more about it here.](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/planning-and-tracking-with-projects/learning-about-projects/about-projects)
- Wiki: This will be used for generic documentation that isn't updated frequently, and isn't used directly in the project.
