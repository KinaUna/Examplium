# Potential next steps for Notes feature

<br/>

### Use DTOs instead of Note data

<br/>

### Add pagination to Notes list

When the number of Notes increases showing all Notes on a page will be slow and cluttered.

Add pagination to limit the number of notes shown, and make it easier to navigate between Notes.

<br/>

### Add sorting

Add sorting options, i.e. sort by date created, date updated, title, category.

<br/>

### Add filtering

Filter Notes by category, tags or date created/updated.

<br/>

### Add search

Search the Notes.

<br/>

### Autocomplete

Implement autocompletion for category and tags.

If there are spelling mistakes, category and tag filtering won't work in many cases. 
By suggesting existing tags and categories it will be easier to ensure consistent spelling.

<br/>

### Share 

Add share Note feature, allowing other users to view a note.
