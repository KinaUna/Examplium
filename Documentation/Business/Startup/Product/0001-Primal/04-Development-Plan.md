# Examplium - Scion - Primal Development Plan

<br/>

Note: This is going to be a very simple initial prototype, it is only intended for internal use to get things started.
This means the project/product plan will be simplified and the work only include part of the processes, workflows, and other planning concepts you might expect from a product plan.

<br/>

### Objective

Create the first essential features of the app: User accounts and notes.

<br/>

### Assumptions

The features are for prototyping only, and will be very basic, more functionality will be added later.

To be used internally only, by developers and maybe some product/project managers and analysts.

It is not meant to be deployed, it should just run on a development computer and doesn't need any database server, web hosting, or any external dependencies.
