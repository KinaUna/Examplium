# Primal Concept Development

### Problem to solve:

This is the inital step for creating apps that can be used for personal information management.

The simplest and most common type of personal information management is note taking.

Problem: As a user I want to be able to save, edit, delete, view and list my notes.


The prototype should be able to save notes, view notes, list notes, edit notes and delete notes.


Notes should be associated with a user, and for now only the creator of a note should be able to see their own notes.

So, user accounts with login, logout, sign up, delete account should be added too.

### Solution:

A web app that allows a user to log in and manage simple text notes.


### Target market:

For internal use only as the foundation for development of a full MVP.
